    <p>A bearded, rugged, lungi- wearing Chitti Babu (Ram Charan) is Rangasthalam’s engineer. With a temper always close to boil, Chitti Babu ‘sees’ sounds. And thus, in an ironic christening, he is called the sound engineer. Rangasthalam’s one-minute teaser shows a lot of promise and has much to excite the watcher. From Ram Charan’s nonchalantly aggressive demeanour to the rich colour shades, the teaser gives an intriguing peek into a place which calls a hearing-impaired engineer, ‘sound engineer’.</p>
